              <Text heading="Project Overview">
              <p>I lead the end-to-end design of personalized, digital campus
              tour web app for <a href="https://www.adoraexperiences.com/index.html" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"> Adora Experiences</a> based on user and market researchâ€¨.
              I iterated on designs, conducted usability testing on a high-fidelity prototype,
              and worked closely with engineers during implementation, taking the app from
              idea to production.

              <Text heading="How can we create a campus visit for the web?">
              <p>As a result of COVID-19, high school students are no longer able to go on
              in-person campus tours. We solved this problem at Adora by launching a web app
              where students can take virtual campus tours of our partner universities.
              My challenge was to design a virtual tour experience that
              felt authentic, captured the campus atmosphere, and provided human connection.

              <Text heading="Reflection">
              <p>Working as a designer an early-stage startup, I learned how to work with multiple stakeholders such as
              high school students, parents, and universities, lead conversations around business strategy,
              and explain my design decisions during regular critiques.
